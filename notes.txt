Features:
term rewriting
compounds should be able to override operators
  ex: lambda Xyz : Vector(("x", "y", "z"))
      vec1 == Xyz()
      vec2 == Xyz()
      vec1 > Vector(0, 0, 0)
      vec2 == Vector(1, 1, 1)
      vec1.dot(vec2) < 1    

interfaces
named maps of terms are zipped during comparison

Wrapper(<expr>, ('term1, 'term2')) = ...
you can substitute, as long as the replacemnt map has the same terms
